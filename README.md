# Home Assistant - Wyze Integration

This is a custom component to allow control of various Wyze devices in Home Assistant using the unofficial API. Please
note this mimics the Wyze app and therefore access may be cut off at anytime.

### Highlights of what **WyzeApi** can do

* Control Wyze Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control Wyze Plugs as switches through HA
* Use Wyze Cameras as motion sensors **NOTE:** Disabled following API usage incident with Wyze
* Turn on and off Wyze Cameras
* Lock, unlock, and view status of lock and door for the Wyze Lock

### Potential Downsides

* This is an unofficial implementation of the api and therefore may be disabled or broken at anytime by WyzeLabs
* ~~***It requires two factor authentication to be disabled on your account***~~ 
* ***Two Factor Authentication is supported as of version 2021.9.2***
